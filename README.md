Caesar Cipher
Description:
It is one of the simplest encryption techniques in which each character in plain text is replaced by a character some fixed number of positions down to it.
Encryption:
For example, if key is 3 then we must replace character by another character that is 3 positions down to it. Like A will be replaced by D, C will be replaced by F and so on, and it can take any key up to 25.
Decryption:
For decryption just follow the reverse of encryption process
